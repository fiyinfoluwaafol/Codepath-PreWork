## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Below are a list of my 3 favorite applications, along with some features that make
them my favorite:

- Gmail:
    - Being able to switch between multiple accounts by swiping upwards or downwards on the profile picture/icon
    - Being able to schedule send emails, rather than having to be there to send out
    the email
- Messages:
    - Being able to edit messages for a period of time after they were sent
    - Being able to pin your favorite/important contacts at the top of yor screen
- Netflix:
    - Auto playing of the next episode of the tv show being watched
    - Being able to download episodes or movies for moments when you are offline
    
Potential App Idea Paragraph
This app would essentially acts as idea journal, it would allow you to keep track
of any ideas you might come up with, by creating a new document for each idea. It
would have the capabilities of allowing the user to type things out, as well have
drawings to accompany the text if the user desires to. Asides from taking notes of
the user's ideas, the app would have a reminder feature that reminds the user of
their ideas weekly (or whatever frequency the user decides), this is so that the
user is encouraged to intentionally attempt to develop more about the idea.
Another potential feature could be having a community feature that allows you the
user to connect with others with a similar idea/innovation, such that they could
potentially partner up to bring whatsoever the idea is into reality.

## Notes

Barely encountered any difficulty developing the app, but after submission of
pre work, I intend to still play around with it and explore all the things I can
do with it.
